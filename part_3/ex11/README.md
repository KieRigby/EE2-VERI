#Experiment 11: D-to-A	conversion	using	pulse-width	modulation

##Objective:

The objective is to learn that digital to analogue conversion can also be done using pulse width modulation.

##Results

We implemented the pmw.v module which were available from lectures. We extended the design from ex12 so that the digital input is also converted using both pmw and spi2dac. We confirmed the results using the oscilloscope and they were the same.
